WBS for Absolute Path

Problem Understanding:

    1) Original requirements: Print the absolute path of the .class file of the current class.

    2) Inferred requirements: Method to get the absolute path of the .class file

    3) Pre-condition: Necessary classes imported from its package

    4) Clarification: Does the .class file exists or not

    5)Acceptance Criteria: Printing the absolute path of the .class file of the current class using a method to get the absolute path of the file with neccesary classes imported form its package.


Jobs to be done:

    1) Events: - Getting the absolute path
               - Displaying the absolute path


   2) Event Scope:
        a) Getting the absolute path
                - from .class file created
                - triggered by getting the absolute path of the .class file
                - to having the absolute path of .class file

        b) Displaying the absolute path
                - from having absolute path
                - triggered by printing statement
                - to absolute path of the file displayed in the output


Design:

    1) Entities:
        a) Getting the absolute path
                 - .class file

        b) Displaying the absolute path
                 - Output console

    2) Pseudo code:

         import java.io.File

         main class {
            main method() {

                creating object of class File;
                String[] variable = getAbsolutePath();
                print (variable);

            }
         }
